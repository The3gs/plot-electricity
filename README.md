# TEP Uasge file reader

This is a simple project I built to read utility statements from TEP (Tucson Electric Power).
Other power companies might use similar formats for their usage csv files, so it might work, but I only have my own data to test with, so it is untested with anything else.

I would like to add daily ranges, as well as the hourly usage. Maybe if I get the urge to work on this again.

## Wasm

The template I used had wasm support, and I have left that in so far, but it is broken because of the file picker.

I don't know enough to fix this, and you need to read the file, so no web version for now.
Maybe later.

## Disclaimer

While this code is released under an open source license, I do not intend to maintain it, but if you as nicely and I'm in a good mood, I might help you out.

No promises of long term support.

This is garbage code I mostly made over a weekend.
