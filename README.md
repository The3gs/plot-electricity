# TEP Uasge file reader

This is a simple project I built to read utility statements from TEP (Tucson Electric Power).
Other power companies might use similar formats for their usage csv files, so it might work, but I only have my own data to test with, so it is untested with anything else.

## Disclaimer

While this code is release under an open source license, I do not intend to maintain it, but if you as nicely and I'm in a good mood, I might help you out.
No promises of long term support.
This is garbage code I mostly made over a weekend.
